<h2 style="text-align:center;font-size:50;font-family:calibri;color:blue;">About</h2>
<p> This website is about the Endangered Species in the world. The conservation status of a species indicates the likelihood that it will become extinct.<br> Many factors are considered when assessing the status of a species; e.g., such statistics as the number remaining, the overall increase or decrease in the population over time, breeding success rates, or known threatsAn endangered species is a species which has been categorized as very likely to become extinct.<br> Endangered (EN), as categorized by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List, is the second most severe conservation status for wild populations in the IUCN's schema after Critically Endangered (CR).The Endangered Species Act has lists of protected plant and animal species both nationally and worldwide.<br> When a species is given ESA protection, it is said to be a "listed" species.<br> Many additional species are evaluated for possible protection under the ESA, and they are called “candidate” species.<br>

<p>The conservation status of a species indicates the likelihood that it will become extinct.<br> Many factors are considered when assessing the status of a species; e.g., such statistics as the number remaining, the overall increase or decrease in the population over time, breeding success rates, or known threats.<br>The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species is the best-known worldwide conservation status listing and ranking system.<br><br>Over 50% of the world's species are estimated to be at risk of extinction. Internationally, 199 countries have signed an accord to create Biodiversity Action Plans that will protect endangered and other threatened species.<br> In the United States, such plans are usually called Species Recovery Plans.<br>The conservation status of a group of organisms (for instance, a species) indicates whether the group still exists and how likely the group is to become extinct in the near future. Many factors are taken into account when assessing conservation status: not simply the number of individuals remaining, but the overall increase or decrease in the population over time, breeding success rates, and known threats. Various systems of conservation status exist and are in use at international, multi-country, national and local levels as well as for consumer use.
